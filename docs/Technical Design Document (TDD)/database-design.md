# Attribute Dictionary

| Attribute | Type | Used In |
|---|---|---|
| `_id` | ObjectId | All collections |
| `user_id` | ObjectId | Assignments |
| `course_id` | ObjectId | Assignments |
| `title` | String | Assignments |
| `description` | String | Assignments |
| `status` | String | Assignments |
| `priority` | String | Assignments |
| `due_date` | Date | Assignments |

# Index Design

Indexes improve database search speed.

| Collection | Index | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Users | email | Faster login search |
| Courses | course_code | Course search |
| Assignments | user_id | Find user assignments |
| Assignments | course_id | Find course assignments |
| Assignments | due_date | Sort deadlines |
| Assignments | status | Filter assignments |

---

# Data Integrity Strategy

## Validation

- Required fields must be provided.
- Invalid data is rejected before storing.

## Unique Constraint

- Email must be unique.
- Prevents duplicate accounts.

## Reference Validation

- `user_id` must match an existing user.
- `course_id` must match an existing course.

## Password Security

- Passwords are stored using hashing.
- Original passwords are never stored.

## Soft Delete

Optional soft delete can be used.

Example:

```json
{
 "is_deleted": true
}
```

# NoSQL Design Discussion

- MongoDB is used because the project requires flexible data storage.
- Collections represent major application entities.
- Relationships are maintained using ObjectId references.
- The design avoids complex SQL joins.
- The database supports fast assignment tracking and easy maintenance.
